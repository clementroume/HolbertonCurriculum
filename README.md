# Holberton School Bridge Curriculum  

Welcome to the **Bridge** directory! This section of the repository is part of the **Holberton School Bridge Curriculum**, a transitional program designed to strengthen foundational knowledge and prepare students for advanced specializations, particularly **Web Full-Stack Development**.  

The Bridge program emphasizes hands-on learning with essential tools and programming languages critical for success in software development, including:  
- üêö **Shell**: Basics of navigation and scripting.  
- üìù **Vi** and **Emacs**: Powerful text editors.  
- üåø **Git**: Version control for collaborative projects.  
- üêç **Python**: Versatile language for object-oriented programming and test-driven development.  
- üîß **C**: Low-level programming for memory management and data structures.  
- üìä **SQL**: Database querying and management.  
- üåê **JavaScript**: Web scraping and DOM manipulation.  

Each section introduces tools and concepts progressively, helping you build a robust foundation for advanced topics like full-stack web development.
