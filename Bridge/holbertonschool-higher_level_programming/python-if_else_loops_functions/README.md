# Python - If/Else, Loops, and Functions

Welcome to the **Python - If/Else, Loops, and Functions** project repository! This project is part of the **Holberton School Higher-Level Programming** curriculum and focuses on strengthening your understanding of Python’s control flow, loops, and functions. Each task builds on basic programming principles, such as working with conditionals, loops, and functions, and helps you become comfortable with Python's syntax and logic.

## Description

This project explores the following key programming concepts in Python:

- **Conditionals**: Using `if`, `if-else`, and `if-elif-else` statements to control the flow of execution based on conditions.
- **Loops**: Working with `for` and `while` loops, including managing loop control with `break`, `continue`, and `else`.
- **Functions**: Defining and calling functions in Python to structure code more efficiently.
- **Variable Scope and Error Handling**: Understanding the role of variables within different scopes and handling errors like tracebacks.
- **Operators and Built-in Functions**: Using Python operators and functions like `range()` to work with data.

The project helps you gain proficiency in these concepts and develop solutions to various programming challenges using control structures and functions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Effectively use Python’s `if`, `if-else`, and `if-elif-else` statements.
- Manage indentation to ensure code blocks are correctly structured.
- Work with loops (`for`, `while`) and control flow inside loops with `break`, `continue`, and `else`.
- Define and call functions in Python.
- Understand variable scope and error handling, including working with tracebacks.
- Apply Python operators and built-in functions like `range()` in practical coding scenarios.
