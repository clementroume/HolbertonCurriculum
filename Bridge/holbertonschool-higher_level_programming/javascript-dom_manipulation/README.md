# JavaScript DOM Manipulation

Welcome to the **JavaScript DOM Manipulation** project repository! This project is part of the **Holberton School Higher-Level Programming** curriculum and focuses on DOM manipulation using JavaScript. It explores various operations to interact with HTML elements dynamically, such as modifying content, handling events, and interacting with APIs.

## Description

The project includes a series of tasks that demonstrate how JavaScript can be used to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) in response to user interactions. The tasks range from changing text content, handling button clicks, manipulating list elements, and fetching data from external APIs.

- Dynamically update HTML content using JavaScript.
- Handle events such as clicks to trigger changes in the page.
- Fetch and display external data from APIs (e.g., translation services and Star Wars API).
- Basic interaction with lists: adding, removing, and clearing items.

This project helps in understanding how JavaScript can interact with the structure of a webpage, making the web experience more interactive and dynamic.

## Project Structure

Here is an overview of the files included in the `javascriot-dom_manipulation` directory:

| **File**        | **Description**                                                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0-script.js`   | Changes the color of the header to red when the script is executed.                |
| `1-script.js`   | Adds an event listener to change the header color to red when a button is clicked. |
| `2-script.js`   | Adds a CSS class `red` to change the header color when a button is clicked.        |
| `3-script.js`   | Toggles between green and red header colors when the button is clicked.            |
| `4-script.js`   | Adds a new item to the list when the button is clicked.                            |
| `5-script.js`   | Updates the text content of the header when the button is clicked.                 |
| `6-script.js`   | Fetches the name of a character from a public API and displays it in the DOM.      |
| `7-script.js`   | Fetches a list of movie titles and displays them in a list.                        |
| `8-script.js`   | Fetches a translation of "Hello" in a selected language and displays it.           |
| `100-script.js` | Adds, removes, and clears items from the list using buttons.                       |
| `101-script.js` | Translates a "Hello" message based on selected language from a dropdown.           |

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, the following objectives are achieved:

- **DOM Manipulation**: Learning how to interact with HTML elements using JavaScript, including adding/removing content and dynamically modifying styles.
- **Event Handling**: Understanding how to handle events like clicks to trigger actions in JavaScript code.
- **API Interaction**: Gaining experience in making asynchronous requests to APIs using `fetch` and displaying the results dynamically.
- **Practical JavaScript Skills**: Enhancing the ability to work with the JavaScript language, including working with DOM nodes, event listeners, and manipulating the `innerHTML` and `textContent` properties.

This project prepares for the creation of dynamic, interactive web pages that respond to user input and external data sources.
