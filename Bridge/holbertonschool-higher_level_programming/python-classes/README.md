# Python Classes - Holberton School

Welcome to the **Python Classes** project repository! This project is part of the **Holberton School Higher-Level Programming** curriculum and explores concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Python. Each task builds upon the previous one, demonstrating OOP principles like encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and special methods.

## Description

This project dives into Python's implementation of Object-Oriented Programming, focusing on:

- Class and object creation.
- Properties, setters, and getters.
- Encapsulation of data.
- Magic methods (like `__str__`, `__eq__`, and comparison operators).
- Use of exception handling in classes.
- Implementation of custom methods in a clean, reusable way.

The repository includes implementations of various tasks involving squares and singly linked lists. Each implementation is modular, adhering to Pythonic conventions.

## Project Structure

Hereâ€™s an overview of the files included in the `python-classes` directory:

| File                        | Description                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0-square.py`               | Defines an empty `Square` class.                                                                         |
| `1-square.py`               | Adds a private instance attribute `size` to the `Square` class.                                          |
| `2-square.py`               | Adds validation for the `size` attribute with type and value checks.                                     |
| `3-square.py`               | Implements a method `area` to calculate the area of the square.                                          |
| `4-square.py`               | Includes property getters and setters for the `size` attribute.                                          |
| `5-square.py`               | Adds a `my_print` method to display the square using the `#` character.                                  |
| `6-square.py`               | Adds a `position` attribute to control the square's printing offset.                                     |
| `100-singly_linked_list.py` | Implements a singly linked list with a `Node` and `SinglyLinkedList` class, allowing sorted insertions.  |
| `101-square.py`             | Adds a `__str__` method to `Square`, allowing it to be printed directly, displaying the square visually. |
| `102-square.py`             | Adds magic methods to enable comparisons (`<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`) based on square area.        |

## Learning Objectives

- Understand Python's object-oriented programming paradigm.
- Learn to encapsulate attributes and expose them through getters and setters.
- Write classes with clean, reusable methods.
- Use Python's special methods to enhance the behavior of custom objects.
- Understand the use of property decorators (`@property` and setters).
- Implement data structures like singly linked lists from scratch.
