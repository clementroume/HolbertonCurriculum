## Description

This project introduces the basics of SQL and relational database management systems (RDBMS). It covers:

- Writing SQL queries to manage and manipulate data.
- Understanding how relational databases work and how to interact with them.
- Performing simple CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Using SQL commands like `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, and others to extract meaningful information from data.

Through this project, hands-on experience with relational databases is gained, and the basic principles of SQL are applied to real-world database management tasks.
