## Description

This repository covers a wide range of topics essential to low-level programming, with projects that gradually increase in complexity. Topics include:

- Mastery of pointers, arrays, and strings.
- Construction and manipulation of data structures like doubly linked lists.
- Memory allocation and deallocation.
- Debugging and writing clean, efficient C code.
- Preparation for advanced topics such as algorithms and operating system concepts.

Each project is designed to reinforce theoretical knowledge through hands-on coding tasks.
