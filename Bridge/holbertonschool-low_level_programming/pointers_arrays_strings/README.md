# C - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings - Holberton School

Welcome to the **C - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings** project repository! This project is part of the **Holberton School Low-Level Programming** curriculum and focuses on understanding and utilizing pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming. These concepts form the foundation for manipulating memory and data structures effectively in C.

## Description

This project explores key concepts related to pointers, arrays, and strings, including:

- How to work with pointers for direct memory manipulation.
- Array traversal and operations.
- String manipulation using pointers and library functions.
- Use of multi-dimensional arrays.
- Implementation of custom functions to replicate standard string library behavior.

The tasks progressively build understanding of these critical components in C programming, allowing for efficient data manipulation.

## Project Structure

Hereâ€™s an overview of the files included in the `pointers_arrays_strings` directory:

| **File**          | **Description**                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `0-reset_to_98.c` | Updates the value of a pointer's target to `98`.                         |
| `1-swap.c`        | Swaps the values of two integers using pointers.                         |
| `2-strlen.c`      | Calculates the length of a string.                                       |
| `3-puts.c`        | Prints a string to stdout followed by a newline.                         |
| `4-print_rev.c`   | Prints a string in reverse.                                              |
| `5-rev_string.c`  | Reverses a string in place.                                              |
| `6-puts2.c`       | Prints every other character of a string, starting with the first.       |
| `7-puts_half.c`   | Prints the second half of a string.                                      |
| `8-print_array.c` | Prints the elements of an integer array, separated by commas.            |
| `9-strcpy.c`      | Copies the string src to the buffer dest, including the null byte.       |
| `100-atoi.c`      | Converts a string to an integer.                                         |
| `main.h`          | Header file containing prototypes for all functions used in the project. |
