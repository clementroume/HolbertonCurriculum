## Description

This project delves into the implementation of doubly linked lists, enabling efficient traversal and modification of data in both directions. It covers essential operations such as node insertion, deletion, and retrieval, along with memory management techniques to ensure clean, leak-free code.

## Project Structure

Hereâ€™s an overview of the files included in the `doubly_linked_lists` directory:

| **File**               | **Description**                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0-print_dlistint.c`   | Prints all elements of a doubly linked list.                                                        |
| `1-dlistint_len.c`     | Returns the number of elements in a doubly linked list.                                             |
| `2-add_dnodeint.c`     | Adds a new node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.                                           |
| `3-add_dnodeint_end.c` | Adds a new node at the end of a doubly linked list.                                                 |
| `4-free_dlistint.c`    | Frees a doubly linked list.                                                                         |
| `5-get_dnodeint.c`     | Returns the nth node of a doubly linked list.                                                       |
| `6-sum_dlistint.c`     | Calculates the sum of all the data in a doubly linked list.                                         |
| `7-insert_dnodeint.c`  | Inserts a new node at a given position in a doubly linked list.                                     |
| `8-delete_dnodeint.c`  | Deletes a node at a specific index in a doubly linked list.                                         |
| `lists.h`              | Header file containing function prototypes and the structure definition for the doubly linked list. |

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the structure and advantages of doubly linked lists over singly linked lists.
- Implement efficient traversal methods in both forward and backward directions.
- Perform common operations like insertion, deletion, and node retrieval.
- Manage memory dynamically to prevent leaks and maintain efficient performance.
- Strengthen your understanding of pointers and dynamic data structures in C.
