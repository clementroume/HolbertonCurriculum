| 0. README and objectives! | Create a webpage from a Figma design file, focusing solely on the semantic HTML structure without any CSS or styling, and write a high-quality README.md for the project. |
| 1. Header                 | Start by creating the HTML skeleton (html, head, body, etc.), then add a header in the body containing a link with an image inside and a block of three link elements. |

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, the following concepts are thoroughly understood:

- **HTML**: Mastery of HTML as the foundational language for structuring and presenting web content. Its role in defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images is clearly understood, enabling accurate rendering in browsers.
- **HTML Page Creation**: Mastery of translating wireframes into structured pages using appropriate tags and elements.
- **Markup Language**: A clear grasp of a markup language as a system for annotating documents, distinguishing structure and semantics through the use of tags and attributes.
- **DOM (Document Object Model)**: An understanding of the DOM as a programming interface representing the structure of a webpage as a tree of objects, allowing dynamic manipulation of content and layout through scripts or programs.
- **Elements and Tags**: Proficiency in recognizing elements as the fundamental building blocks of HTML, consisting of tags, content, and attributes. A tag's role in defining content types (e.g., headings with `<h1>` or images with `<img>`) is fully understood.
- **Attributes**: A comprehensive understanding of attributes as additional information within elements, provided as name-value pairs to define properties or behaviors (e.g., `class="header"`, `src="image.jpg"`).
- **HTML Tags**: Their purposes are clear, including headings (`<h1>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), links (`<a>`), images (`<img>`), and grouping (`<div>`, `<ul>`).

This ensures a strong foundation for explaining and applying HTML concepts in practical scenarios.
